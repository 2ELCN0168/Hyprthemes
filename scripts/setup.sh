#! /bin/bash

#
# This script MUST BE LAUNCHED as the first one before anything else after the 
# repository has been downloaded. Otherwise, any theme will work.
#
# It automatically detects the path where the repository is located on
# the system. Then, it adds an environment variable with the path.
# It is used by change_theme.sh and configurations files.
#
# It aims to be modular and to avoid static path. The user must control where 
# they want the repository on their system.
#
# If the automatic path does not satisfy the user, the user can write it 
# manually, but the script will only check if the path exists on the system, not
# if it's correct.
#
# Something else: The script make a backup of all your dotfiles. Like that, the
# change_theme.sh and change_theme_mode.sh scripts cannot destroy your personnal
# files. The backup is saved at "${HOME}/.config/YOUR_DOTFILES_BACKUP".
#
# /!\ It only does a backup of the files modified by the themes. /!\
